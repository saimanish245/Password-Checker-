# Password-Checker-# 🔐 Password Strength Checker (Python)

This is a simple Python script that validates the strength of a user-entered password based on basic security rules using regular expressions (`re` module).

## 📋 Features

The script checks for the following password strength criteria:

- ✅ Minimum length of 8 characters
- ✅ At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- ✅ At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- ✅ At least one digit (0-9)
- ✅ At least one special character (`@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `!`)

If all conditions are satisfied, it prints:  
**`Password is strong`**

Otherwise, it gives feedback on which conditions are not met.

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

### 🖥️ Run the script:
```bash
python password_checker.py
